/**
 * An object that performs a cleanup operation when `.dispose()` is called.
 *
 * Some examples of how disposables are used:
 *
 * - An event listener that removes itself when `.dispose()` is called.
 * - A resource such as a file system watcher that cleans up the resource when `.dispose()` is called.
 * - The return value from registering a provider. When `.dispose()` is called, the provider is unregistered.
